# ü©∫ Lung Cancer Classification Research

This is a research-driven deep learning project focused on the **classification of lung cancer** using CT scan images. The study evaluates multiple CNN architectures to accurately classify lung conditions into three categories: **Normal**, **Benign**, and **Malignant**, aiming to assist radiologists and improve early cancer detection.

## üìå Objective

- Develop an automated lung cancer detection system using CT-Scan image classification.
- Compare the performance of CNN architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetv2).
- Analyze trade-offs in terms of accuracy, training time, and resource usage.
- Build a lightweight and scalable diagnostic system for clinical settings.

## üß† Methodology

- **Dataset:** IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung CT Scan Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Classes:** `Normal`, `Benign`, `Malignant`
- **Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, data augmentation, oversampling
- **Models Used:**
  - `ResNet50`: Deep residual learning
  - `DenseNet121`: Feature reuse with dense connections
  - `MobileNetv2`: Efficient model for resource-constrained environments
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
